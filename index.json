The harder excerpts were drawn from the following musical styles: Romantic music, ﬁlm soundtracks, blues, chanson and solo guitar.\nThis dataset has been designed for radically new techniques which can contend with challenging beat tracking situations like: quiet accompaniment, expressive timing, changes in time signature, slow tempo, poor sound quality etc. So, if your beat tracker likes a 4\u0026frasl;4 time-signature with a steady tempo and needs clear percussive onsets, don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to do very well! But don\u0026rsquo;t be deterred, this is for the good of beat tracking.\nThis dataset includes:\nBeat annotations and supporting meta-data Audio excerpts\nUpdate 5th August 2014: please note the annotations for excerpts 056, 137, 153, 203 and 257 have been updated to remove the final beat annotations which were out of range. Thanks to Andy Lambert for pointing this out.
